# ai_agents_prompts

Purpose: A small collection of agent prompt templates and documentation for creating, testing, and maintaining AI agent prompts.

Contents
- `readme-specialist.md` — guidance and metadata for a README specialist persona used to craft documentation.
- `analysis-specialist.md` — (metadata/spec) for an analysis specialist persona.
- `yamlheader-specialist.md` — helper metadata files for prompt templates.

Quick start

1. Read the specialist doc files to understand each persona and their responsibilities.
2. Copy or adapt the prompt templates for your project or experiments.

Why this repo exists

Usage examples

- To use a README specialist prompt, open `readme-specialist.md` and adapt the guidance into a prompt for your agent. Include project-specific details (name, install steps, usage examples) when you call the agent.
- For quick experiments, copy one of the specialist files into your prompt input and fill in project-specific data.
